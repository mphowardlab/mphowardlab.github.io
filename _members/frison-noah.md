Noah joined the lab in 2022 and currently works with Brennan to investigate the
properties of alcohol and water mixtures, with a particular focus on diffusion
coefficients and viscosity. The ultimate goal of his work is to understand
multicomponent transport of such mixtures through polymer membranes.  Noah is
pursuing a job in industry.
