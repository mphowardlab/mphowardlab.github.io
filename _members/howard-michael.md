Michael P. Howard is an Assistant Professor of Chemical Engineering at Auburn
University. He received his B.S. in Chemical Engineering from Penn State
University and his Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering from Princeton University. His
research uses computer simulations and statistical mechanics to understand and
design soft materials—including nanoparticles, polymers, and composites—with a
focus on nonequilibrium problems where thermodynamic and transport effects
compete to determine a material’s structure and properties.
