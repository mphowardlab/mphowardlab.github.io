Michael P. Howard is an Assistant Professor of Chemical Engineering at Auburn
University. He received his B.S. in Chemical Engineering from Penn State
University and his Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering from Princeton University. His
research aims to use modeling and computer simulations to shorten the time and
reduce the cost of designing soft materials. A key focus is on modeling
self-assembling materials under realistic processing and use conditions, which
are difficult to describe because they are often far from equilibrium. He
received an ACS PRF Doctoral New Investigator grant in 2023 and NSF CAREER
award in 2025.
