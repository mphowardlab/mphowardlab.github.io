Michael P. Howard is an Assistant Professor of Chemical Engineering at Auburn University. He received his B.S. in Chemical Engineering from Penn State University and his Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering from Princeton University. His research uses computer simulations and statistical mechanics to understand and design soft materials—including nanoparticles, polymers, and composites—with a focus on nonequilibrium problems where thermodynamic and transport effects compete to determine a material’s structure and properties.
