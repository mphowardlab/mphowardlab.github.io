Matthew worked in the lab as an undergraduate researcher in Summer 2023 through
the CoMSEF Scholars REU. As a student in both chemical engineering and
computer science, he worked to update our software for simulating hydrodynamic
interactions in soft materials using the multiparticle collision dynamics (MPCD)
method. This software is publicly distributed in [HOOMD-blue][1].
