Matthew worked in the lab as an undergraduate researcher in Summer 2023 through
the [CoMSEF Scholars REU][1]. As a student in both chemical engineering and
computer science, he coded an updated software for simulating hydrodynamic
interactions in soft materials using the multiparticle collision dynamics (MPCD)
method. He will graduate from Auburn in May 2024.
