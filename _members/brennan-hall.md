Brennan joined the lab in 2022 and currently works with Noah to investigate the
properties of alcohol and water mixtures, with a particular focus on diffusion
coefficients and viscosity. The ultimate goal of his work is to understand
multicomponent transport of such mixtures through polymer membranes. Brennan is
pursuing an industry job in the energy field after graduation.
