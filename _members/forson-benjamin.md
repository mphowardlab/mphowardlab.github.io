Benjamin joined the lab in 2024. His research uses computer modeling to 
understand—and eventually optimize—the energy efficiency of materials for 
advanced bus technologies. Additionally, he is using molecular simulations to 
study transport properties  of multicomponent systems through polymer membranes.
