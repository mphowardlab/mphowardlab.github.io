Brennan joined the lab in 2022 and works with Noah to investigate the mixing properties of alcohol and water, with a particular focus on diffusion coefficients and viscosity, in order to develop a model for the subsequent diffusion of the mixture through a membrane. Brennan is pursuing an industry job in the energy field after graduation.
