Grace joined the lab as its first undergraduate researcher in 2021. She started
working on simulating diffusion and sedimentation of spherical colloids using
the multiparticle collision dynamics method to model hydrodynamic interactions.
In 2022, she was awarded an undergraduate research fellowship from Auburn
University's [Center for Polymers and Advance Composites][1] to study diffusion
and sedimentation for nanoparticles with anisotropic shapes. Grace plans to
pursue a Ph.D. in chemical engineering upon graduation.
