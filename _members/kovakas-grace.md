Grace joined the lab as its first undergraduate researcher in 2021 and worked in
the lab until 2024. She simulated the diffusion and sedimentation of spherical
and shape-anisotropic nanoparticles using the multiparticle collision dynamics
method to model hydrodynamic interactions. She was awarded an undergraduate
research fellowship from Auburn University's
[Center for Polymers and Advance Composites][1] in 2022 and was the recipient of
the Chemical Engineering Outstanding Student award and the President's Award for
the College of Engineering in 2024.
