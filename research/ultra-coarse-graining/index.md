Viral capsids are spontaneously self-assembling structures, forming a protective shell that surrounds the virus's genetic material. Self-assembly plays a critical role in the virus life cycle and understanding the dynamics of the process can create an avenue for designing therapeutics; however, capturing the dynamics of self-assembly through conventional computer simulations, like atomistic simulations, is challenging due to the problem's inherent multidimensionality.

To address this challenge, our research, in collaboration with Dr. Kieslich, introduces an ultra-coarse-grained model for more efficient simulation of the self-assembly process. This approach systematically integrates surrogate modeling methodology, sparse sampling techniques, and established coarse-grained theory. The result can be a precise and efficient approximation of the protein's energy landscape, ideal for simulating viral capsid self-assembly.

More broadly, this research provides a foundational tool for simulating other mesoscale phenomena, including the self-assembly of synthetic materials.
