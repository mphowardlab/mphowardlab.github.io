Currently, this research study involves two kinds of simulation techniques. For one of them, we use particle based simulation technique based on multi-particle collision dynamics (MPCD) to study transport properties of various novel particle shapes. To compute the various transport property, sedimentation simulations are conducted for the different particle shapes considered using the MPCD method.

For the other one, we use a continuum simulation technique based on dynamic density functional theory (DDFT). We are trying to understand the thermodynamic and transport parameters required to achieve desired structures using evaporation-induced self-assembly in multi-component drying colloidal suspension. In addition to this we use established particle-based simulation softwares such as HOOMD to see the overall structure evolution of the drying nano-particle system.
