Nanoparticles or colloidal dispersions play a vital role in our daily lives. From paints to catalysts, can be produced using colloidal dispersions. If a dispersion has different types of particles, various aspects can be controlled to make it self-assemble into desired structures. One such aspect we are controlling in this study is solvent evaporation. Solvent evaporation allows us to create self-assembled coatings and supraparticles cheaply and efficiently. However, it is hard to know what combination of parameters, such as evaporation rate, particle sizes, initial film or droplet length, etc., would result in the desired structure when using the solvent evaporation method.

In this research, we use different kind simulation techniques to understand the thermodynamic and transport properties of the solvent evaporation driven self assembly process. Understanding parameters would allow us to the tune necessary parameters to establish various novel structures in various geometries such as films, droplets etc.
