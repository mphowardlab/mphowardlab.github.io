Materials made by assembling nanoparticles into larger structures are important
for numerous technologies, ranging from consumer products such as paints to
advanced materials used for catalysis or photonics. Typically these materials
are made by dispersing the nanoparticles in a solvent at low concentrations,
then removing the solvent to solidify them. The final self-assembled structure
of the nanoparticles, and its corresponding material properties, can depend
sensitively on how the nanoparticle dispersion is processed. This is especially
true when the dispersion contains multiple types of nanoparticles.

We are particularly interested in using the evaporation of the solvent itself to
create materials coatings or bigger "supraparticles" with composition gradients
cheaply and efficiently. However, it is hard to know what combination of
parameters, such as evaporation rate or nanoparticle size/chemistry will
produced the desired structure after the solvent is removed.

We are using different simulation methods, including both particle-based and
continuum-level modeling, to understand how thermodynamic and transport effects
influence evaporation-driven self-assembly. Our ultimate goal is to
computationally design conditions that produce a targeted self-assembled
structure.
