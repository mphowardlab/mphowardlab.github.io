Some nanocrystals exhibit remarkable properties that make them promising components of advanced sensors and photocatalytic devices. The properties of individual nanocrystals can be enhanced and controlled by assembling them into periodically ordered superlattices; however, there are limited scalable strategies for fabricating them. 
 
Our research addresses this problem by engineering a novel computational approach for creating nanocrystal superlattices with controllable properties. We are computationally engineering a self-assembly strategy for fabricating nanocrystal superlattices by cycling between atomistic simulations and coarse-grained inverse design simulations. We aim to design nanocrystals, directly testable in a laboratory, that assemble into superlattices. 


This work not only advances the fundamental understanding of self-assembly but also offers a broadly applicable tool for designing nanocrystals superlattices to solve engineering challenges in many fields.
